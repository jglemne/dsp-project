# Digital Signal Processing - Random number generators
Practical discrete time stochastic processes and tests of randomness.

### RNGs
Currently only using two implementations; standard accept-reject and inverse transformation method.

### Test
Using a proprietary implementation of the Non-overlapping Template Matching Test, based on "A Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators for Cryptographic Applications" from NIST.
Project in the course EE706 Digital Signal Processing at University of Auckland 2016.
